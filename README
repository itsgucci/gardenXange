* Summary *

The gardenXchange is an open-source Rails web project devised from a common problem shared amoung gardeners everywhere:
  What do you do with excess produce?
  How can you minimize wasted food?

Initially conceived after several trips to various Hawaiian islands, I promised myself I would create a prototype to share with the community.
